# Instacart_Market_Data_Analysis
The Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset is a publicly available dataset on Kaggle that contains transactional data from the 
Instacart grocery delivery service. 
The dataset includes information on over 3 million orders, including the products that were ordered and the order history for each customer. 
The goal of this project is to analyze the data and provide insights into customer behavior and product popularity within the Instacart service.

### Conclusions from data analysis:

The average basket size is 10.59 products per order, which suggests that customers are generally ordering a large number of items at once.
The repeat customer rate is 100.9%, which indicates that Instacart has a relatively high level of customer loyalty.
The average time between orders is 19.01 days, which suggests that customers are using the Instacart service on a regular basis.
The most popular aisle by department varies widely, with fresh fruits and vegetables being the most popular aisle in the produce department, 
and milk being the most popular aisle in the dairy department.
The most popular product by department also varies widely, with bananas being the most popular product in the produce department, 
and organic whole milk being the most popular product in the dairy department.
Orders are most active during the day, with a peak at around 10am, and tapering off in the evening.


Overall, these insights can be used by Instacart to better understand their customers and optimize their service to meet customer needs and preferences. 
For example, Instacart may want to consider offering promotions or discounts on popular products or departments, 
or increasing their marketing efforts during peak order times to attract new customers. 
Additionally, Instacart may want to consider offering personalized recommendations or loyalty programs to encourage customers to order more frequently 
and increase their loyalty to the service.
